# 🌿 Aadi’s Creations — A Holistic Wellness Website

Hey there 👋  
This is **Aadi’s Creations**, a calm, minimal, and fully responsive website built to represent a holistic wellness brand.  
It focuses on yoga, reiki, crystal healing, and natural soaps — everything that helps people slow down, breathe, and reconnect.

I built this using **HTML** and **CSS**, keeping the vibe soft, balanced, and organic — just like the brand itself.
